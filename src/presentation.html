  <div class="explanation">
    <h3>The Spin System</h3>
    <p>You get up to <strong>3 spins every 12 hours</strong>. Each spin lands on either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Migraine relief tasks</strong> – breathing exercises, hydration reminders, posture checks, light breaks.</li>
      <li><strong>Green tasks</strong> – small enjoyable boosts like:
        <ul>
          <li>Buy a drink you like</li>
          <li>Play a game you enjoy</li>
          <li><strong>Order takeout 🎉</strong> (rare bonus slice)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Every spin gives something positive: helpful tasks or a mood boost.</p>

  <div class="points-info">
    <h3>Why Spins Give Points</h3>
    <p>You also earn points every time you spin. The points aren’t random — they scale with your <strong>local migraine weather risk</strong> from our weather analyzer tool.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Higher migraine risk → more points.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Lower risk → fewer points.</strong></li>
      <li>You can spin even on good days, but high-risk days reward more.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This creates a mindset shift: instead of thinking “my day is ruined,” you might think:</p>
    <p><em>“Okay… migraine coming, but at least I’ll get a lot of points and good tasks today.”</em></p>

    <h3>Why This System Works</h3>
    <p>The goal is to turn a difficult moment into something manageable:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Spinning gives relief-focused tasks.</li>
      <li>You look forward to points instead of dreading symptoms.</li>
      <li>You stay consistent because it’s fun, not stressful.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Everything is built to help you prevent, reduce, or better handle migraine episodes — with a bit of positive reinforcement on top.</p>
